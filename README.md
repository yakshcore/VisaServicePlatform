## Application Reference Format

Every application gets a unique reference in the format `PRS-{COUNTRY}-{NNNN}`:

```
PRS-IND-4827   (India)
PRS-USA-2391   (United States)
PRS-GBR-7044   (United Kingdom)
```

This reference appears on the application detail page and on the PDF payment receipt.

## Application Status Pipeline

```
Submitted → Documents Under Review → Documents Approved
  → Payment Pending → Payment Completed → Visa Processing
    → Embassy Review → Visa Approved → Visa Delivered
                    ↘ Visa Rejected
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- Cloudinary account
- Gmail account with App Password enabled (or Brevo SMTP)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd VisaServicePlatform
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp backend-api/.env.example backend-api/.env
```

Fill in `backend-api/.env`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/pravasatransworld
JWT_SECRET=your_secure_secret
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=...
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=...
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=...
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=you@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

Create `.env.local` in both portals:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 3. Seed the Database

```bash
npm run seed
```

Creates 1 admin, 8 countries, and 3 visa types.

**Default admin credentials:**
- Email: `admin@pravasatransworld.com`

### 4. Run the Platform

Open three terminals:

```bash
npm run dev:backend   # API on http://localhost:5000
